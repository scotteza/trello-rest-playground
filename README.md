# Trello REST Playground

Playing with Trello's [REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/).

This was a fun experiment, but I won't be taking it any further.

If you are looking for a way to hit the Trello REST API from C# code, [this library](https://github.com/cdmdotnet/Manatee.Trello/) looks like an interesting option. I can't comment on its effectiveness as I haven't tried it yet.
